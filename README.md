## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

I started with basic html markup and classes before working top down adding my typography adding styling as I went out, once happy with the layout I then focused on desktop responsive

### What I learned

Renforcing previous learning on using flexbox for components and some other flex properties like flex basis


### Continued development

Continue to work using flex especially when working with images still feels a bit of an anomaly with how they react to css.
